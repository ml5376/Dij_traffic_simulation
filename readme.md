# Simulation of Traffic on a simple graph:
the repo contains a matlab simulation of two-way traffic, with the dots as simulated car that generated at random location on a simple graph;
The Dijkstra and dot product are chosen as the path finding algorithm and we want to find out the optimal algorithm put to use in case of design of navigation app in terms of how fast the car can arrive to its destination.

The effect of simulation:
